[Description]( https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6 )

Moved the app into an [astro blog](https://astro.build/blog/introducing-astro/).
Seems like a good way to present them.

This is also the first day I needed to give up on a detailed visualization. 
Luckily I quickly found I could join lanternfish with same number - so maths to the rescue.

Also figured in hindsight this might be a case for dynamic programming for a more CS approach to the solution.
